At the suggestion of my wife, I'm trying to reboot a blog on thoughts related to my pursuit of God. I used to blog on this topic when I was in pursuit of a far more liberal theology: Emergent church, postmodernism, relativism, etc. Many years have passed since that time and God has turned many of those leanings back towards a more conservative view, although some of that transformation has happened only recently. I am, as always, a work in progress, which is why I've named this blog as such. 

The things here initially will more often be thoughts from others, books I'm reading, sermons I'm watching, and most importantly Scripture I'm pondering. Perhaps over time it will grow to include more original thought. I freely confess in advance that any error found here is my own. All good that flows from this into other's lives is solely from God. I do not desire to write here to prove the worth or value of myself or my own mind but rather to encourage and hopefully enrich the lives of those who read and ultimately to reflect the glory of God in his working in my life. 

All glory to God alone, not from my own working or adding to him in any way, but only his glory reflected off me back to him.

> And you were dead in the trespasses and sins in which you once walked, following the course of this world, following the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience -- among whom we all once lived in the passions of our flesh, carrying out the desires of the body and the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, like the rest of mankind. But God, being rich in mercy, because of the great love with which he loved us, even when we were dead in our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ -- by grace you have been saved -- and raised us up with him and seated us with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, so that in the coming ages he might show the immeasurable riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus. For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast. For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them. - (Ephesians 2:1-10 ESV)
