On "the scariest verse in the Bible":

> The question is not do you know Jesus, it's does he know you. Are you known by him?
>
> \- R.C. Sproul (from [here](http://www.ligonier.org/learn/sermons/build-rock/){:target="_blank"})

> “Why do you call me 'Lord, Lord,' and not do what I tell you? Everyone who comes to me and hears my words and does them, I will show you what he is like: he is like a man building a house, who dug deep and laid the foundation on the rock. And when a flood arose, the stream broke against that house and could not shake it, because it had been well built. But the one who hears and does not do them is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation. When the stream broke against it, immediately it fell, and the ruin of that house was great.”
> (Luke 6:46-49 ESV)
