Take things I say with the knowledge that I believe firmly in the passage "The one who states his case first seems right, until the other comes and examines him." I believe too, as someone said, in "strong opinions held lightly." I understand I am fallible, I often misunderstand, and most often act out of the knowledge that puffs up, rather than love that edifies. I desire to say things strongly because I believe them with conviction and have the desire to act on them. I will do my best to hear criticism graciously and with a willingness to be wrong and corrected. 

I say this mostly because I have two extensive blog posts coming which are stated fairly strongly. I have realized my method of writing has become more firm in the way I state things and I want to be sure the attitude behind it is clear. I do it in part to stirr up discussion from those who might be able to pull out the nuances of where I am missing the point or redirect misguidedness into wisdom.

Thank you all for your patience with me.
