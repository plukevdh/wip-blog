I often hear caution about using Old Testament passages spoken to the nation of Israel and using it in application for the Church or ourselves as individuals today. The two verses I hear most often placed in this category are Jeremiah 29:11:

> For I know the plans I have for you, declares the LORD, plans for welfare and not for evil, to give you a future and a hope.

and 2 Chronicles 7:14:	

> [I]f my people who are called by my name humble themselves, and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and heal their land.

The first was a promise to Israel that he would return them from Babylon after the land had its seventy years of rest. The other is spoken to Solomon when speaking of the temple, how God promised that his eyes would be upon the land in which the temple was built to hear the prayers of those made in "this place" (spoken of the temple, v. 15).

So I see the point made that we ought not wildly apply these promises to ourseves. But I also wonder sometimes about the imagery being created in the history of Israel as a representation of God's larger redemptive plan for "His chosen people", not in the sense that "the Church is the new Israel" but rather "Israel was imaging the Church." 

John Piper harps on the definition of what it means to image something, though I think it worthwhile. My closest available dictionary defines it, among many other ways, as "to make a visual representation of something". It is to take something we either can't see or have a hard time otherwise describing, and to put it into visible form. Using that definition, we can understand more easily that Christ is the image of the invisible God (Colossians 1:15), and I believe in many ways, Israel was an image of the Church yet-to-be. 

Throughout the Old Testament, there are people who represent or image--in various ways and all imperfectly--Christ. We have Joseph and his saving the family of Jacob, the fathers of the nation of Israel, from famine by being placed in power in Egypt. We have Moses as a deliverer of that same and much-multiplied nation acting as an agent of God's deliverance of his "chosen people." We have David, the man after God's own heart, who delivered the people from the surrounding nations so that the land had peace in Solomon's day. All (and many more) in some way image Jesus's work in saving a larger body of people in the world. Many of the New Testament authors speak of this

> Concerning this salvation, the prophets who prophesied about the grace that was to be yours searched and inquired carefully, inquiring what person or time the Spirit of Christ in them was indicating when he predicted the sufferings of Christ and the subsequent glories. **It was revealed to them that they were serving not themselves but you**, in the things that have now been announced to you through those who preached the good news to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven, things into which angels long to look. (1 Peter 1:10-12 ESV)

And so, while there are many promises given _specifically_ to the nation of Israel, if Israel is an image of the Church-to-be, I wonder if many of things that reveal God's desire for His people in the promises to a specific national people also apply to the wider Body of Christ.

These wonderings stem from my reading in Isaiah 8 this morning, where God is speaking to Israel with the following command upon Isaiah:

> "For the Lord spoke thus to me with his strong hand upon me, and warned me _not to walk in the way of this people_ [Israel], saying: _'Do not call conspiracy all that this people  calls conspiracy, and do not fear what they fear, nor be in dread._ But the Lord of hosts, him shall you honor as holy. Let him be your fear and let him be your dread. And he will become a sanctuary and a stone of offense and a rock of stumbling to both houses of Israel, a trap and a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem. And many shall stumble on it. They shall fall and be broken; they shall be snared and taken."

The first command is what draws my attention initially: "Do not walk in the way of this people." What first strikes me is this is the same command given _to Israel_ as they travel to the promised land:

> And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, â€œSpeak to the people of Israel and say to them, I am the LORD your God. You shall not do as they do in the land of Egypt, where you lived, and you shall not do as they do in the land of Canaan, to which I am bringing you. You shall not walk in their statutes. (Leviticus 18:1-3 ESV)

Now this command is being given to Isaiah about _Israel!_ It's as though there is a picture-within-a-picture is being created, as Israel was intended to represent God's separating out a people for himself from the nations for the sake of his name among the nations, so now Isaiah is being separated out from Israel as an image to Israel. It's as though the lens is being narrowed from a larger picture into a more focused point. This causes me to ask two questions:

1. What then is the purpose of Israel if God is now, for the sake of this judgement, "rejecting" Israel by separating one man from it as set apart for God?
2. What does this mean for the larger context of "the nations" if God's chosen people are being rejected?

(There is also a third question, "What of God's promises to Israel? Is God a liar?" but I believe Romans 9 more adequately answers that and is beyond my scope.)

I think those questions have much deeper answers than I am going to give here. Ultimately I think this is again a picture of God choosing for himself specific people to set apart for his name's sake among the people he did _not_ choose. Whether that was Israel from the nations, Isaiah from Israel or the Church from the world at large. This is a theme I see over and over again in the Old Testament. 

Now, this could lead us into a discussion on election, but that's not my goal. The reason I think this identification of the theme of unique separation is important here is so that we can understand the application of the command. And to review, the command is: "Do not call conspiracy all that this people calls conspiracy, and do not fear what they fear, nor be in dread. But the Lord of hosts, him shall you honor as holy. Let him be your fear and let him be your dread." And if this is a command, we need to know if it applies to us, because if it does, we need to do it. Most of us like to apply the all the promises of blessing to ourselves but would rather leave out the commands.

And part of why I think this command extends beyond Isaiah alone and is purposed for a wider audience is the prophecy that comes along with the command to Isaiah: "[H]e will become a sanctuary and a stone of offense and a rock of stumbling to both houses of Israel"
