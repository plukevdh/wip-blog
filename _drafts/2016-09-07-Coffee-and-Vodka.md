For some reason, the phrase "God, give me coffee to change the things I can and wine to accept the things I cannot" and it's variations have been piling up a lot recently, probably in articles I've read and Facebook posts scrolled by. I got to thinking about it briefly and how it's so characteristic of the culture to treat _symptoms_ of pain and difficulty in our lives via various forms of self-medication and in the midst of things to make it sound like religious piety. What is the message behind statements like this?

1. We have a need for change.
2. Power to change comes from external sources.
3. There are things we cannot change.
4. Those things we need to accept.
5. Our acceptance is possible only via external help.
6. By "acceptance" we really mean "forgetfulness", as alcohol is almost always a means of escape, not resolution.

Some of these points are valid, namely 1-3, even 5. The others we will come to different conclusions about given our moral basis and how we define things like "external help" and "acceptance". Now I don't want to come off too strongly against a very flighty statement, made more for comedic relief than as a life motto, but I think most of us know people who live by these things, even if they don't say it explicitly. Instead, briefly, I want to counter with what I think is the Christian equivalent of this statement.

I think we would all agree, regardless of cultural or religious persuasion that we have room for improvement in our lives. We could probably differ on the source of power or enablement for change. For example, mystics and much popular psychology would argue that the power to change is within us[^1]. Others would state that power comes from an external power of some kind wether that be a deity, an experience, or a substance. Speaking from a specifically Christian context, I believe that power comes from God as the external source, both as it relates to changing ourselves and in our dealings with things we are powerless to change, internally or externally. I would change the phrase to be this:

> God give me the Holy Spirit to empower me to change the things I can, and grace and prayer to live within the things I cannot.

This phrasing would stem from the following Scriptures.
