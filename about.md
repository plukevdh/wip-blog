Hi.

All you really need to know about me is I was once a wicked man, but that man was put to death by God in his son, Jesus Christ.

I am now a new man, called out of death to life unending. All evil that remains in me still is my own doing and I desire with eagerness and many tears the removal of the wickedness that yet remains. I am unable to do this alone but rather am _being made_ by a Holy God into **his** likeness. All good in me is simply a reflection of the Only Good God.

This blog is meant to be a reflection of that inner tension. All error found within the writing here is my own. Any good that comes from it is by the hand of the Sovereign God.

All glory to him.
